Concatenate is a simple but effective way for users to
track the repetition of tasks and form habits.

### The concept is simple:
1. A new user ("The User") logs into our app.
2. The User adds one (or more) new daily task(s) e.g., "write", "program", "meditate", etc. to be tracked.
3. Tracked tasks (called "Chains") last for each day that The User logs in and clicks "concat!" on the daily task they have performed. In this way, Chains, marked by passing days, grow longer, providing users with a visual representation of incremental progress. If The User fails to log onto the app and continue the Chain, the Chain is broken, forcing her to start over.
4. See how long you can keep it going!

#### Planning process / problem solving strategies
The idea for this app stems from advice that developer and comic Brad Isaac received from Jerry Seinfield in a comedy club. Isaac tells it like this:

> Years ago when Seinfeld was a new television show, Jerry Seinfeld was still a touring comic. At the time, I was hanging around clubs doing open mic nights and trying to learn the ropes. One night I was in the club where Seinfeld was working, and before he went on stage, I saw my chance. I had to ask Seinfeld if he had any tips for a young comic. What he told me was something that would benefit me a lifetime...  He said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to write every day. But his advice was better than that. He had a gem of a leverage technique he used on himself and you can use it to motivate yourselfâ€”even when you don't feel like it.  He revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write. Here's how it works.  He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker.  He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."  "Don't break the chain," he said again for emphasis.[1](https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626 "source")

It took me a while to realize the importance of incremental growth, but now that I do, I can't overstate its benefits enough. By doing something once a day, a person can transform themselves, bit by bit. For that reason the above quote resonated with me.

I began the process of building an app from the ground up. I started with user stories and ERDs, picked which tools to use and began to articulate, on paper first, then programmatically, how the data might be stored, then be retrieved and displayed on the client side.

I started with the server, because I needed to devise a way of storing data that evolves with time. This enterprise was more difficult than I initially imagined because of two unforseeables:
1. Using Express with Mongoose is hard as ****. It's not at all an intuitive technology to pick up and persisting evolving nested data sets is neither simple nor well-documented.
2. Dealing with JavaScript's Date objects is a pain. I'm not that quantitative to begin with, and having to manipulate Date objects and then convert from milliseconds to minutes/hours/days and back leaves a ton of room for error.
Which is not to say I didn't enjoy solving date/time puzzles or taming the legendary Mongoose. In fact, I very much did.

The next hurdle I volunteered myself to overcome was using React. I'm glad I spent time familiarizing myself with React, as it's a tool I want to use for future projects; however I really could have stuck to Vanilla JS for this one.

Most of my process involved trial by fire. I'd stare at a big problem (how to represent the chains programmatically) and parse it into subproblems (what is a chain? an array of days. how to store it in the backend? as an object containing first and last day. how does the chain break? if it's been 48 hours since the user last added to the chain.  )

#### Goals for Future Incarnations
Ideally, I'd like for this to be an app, with reminders and whatnot. Bar that, I want to display the "chains" on a full-year calendar, rather than as discrete threads. I'd like to present the user with more data on their chains (totalDaysTracked, combinedChainLength, etc.). Finally I'd like to make the UI satisfying to view and use.

##### Technologies Used
