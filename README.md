# concatenate-api
The server side of an app designed to display progress.

Concatenate is a simple, straightforward way for users to
track tasks and (hopefully) form habits.

## Steps:
1. A new user logs into our app.
2. User adds one (or more) new daily task(s) e.g., write; program; meditate; etc to be tracked.
3. Tracked tasks (called "Chains") last for as long as each day said user logs in and clicks "concatenate!" on the daily task they have performed. In this way, Chains, marked by passing days, grow longer, providing users with a visual representation of incremental progress. If the user fails to log onto the app, the Chain is broken, forcing the user to start over.
