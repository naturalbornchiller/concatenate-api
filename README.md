# concatenate-api
The server side of an app designed to display progress.
Here is the [client side](http://github.com/naturalbornchiller/concatenate-client "concatenate-client") repo.

Links to the deployed [back]() and [front]()end, respectively.

Concatenate is a simple but effective way for users to
track the repetition of tasks and form habits.

### The concept is simple:
1. A new user ("The User") logs into our app.
2. The User adds one (or more) new daily task(s) e.g., "write", "program", "meditate", etc. to be tracked.
3. Tracked tasks (called "Chains") last for each day that The User logs in and clicks "concat!" on the daily task they have performed. In this way, Chains, marked by passing days, grow longer, providing users with a visual representation of incremental progress. If The User fails to log onto the app and continue the Chain, the Chain is broken, forcing her to start over.
4. See how long you can keep it going!
